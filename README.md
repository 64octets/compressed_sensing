# compressed_sensing
Image compression using compressed sensing.

## Summary
This repository is under development as part of a class project for UC Berkeley's EE227BT Convex Optimization course. The authors are David Fridovich-Keil and Grace Kuo, both graduate students in the EECS department at UC Berkeley.

Our aim is apply theoretical results from compressed sensing to the problem of image compression, with the eventual goal of pushing the limits of current research in image compression, as well as in algorithms for compressed sensing.
