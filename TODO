To do list:
* Try LASSO on vanilla DCT (e.g. replace "top k" with sparse LASSO solution -- we expect this to give a worse result)
* Re-write sketching stuff to be blockwise on the entire image (expect better compression ratios)
* Build in oversampling with a random measurement matrix A. Apply this in image domain and DCT domain.
